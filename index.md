## ‚úàÔ∏è Try it

### Download & Run

Download the newest build from the [Release](https://github.com/hv0905/HacknetOS/releases) page or from
our [continuous integration](https://github.com/hv0905/HacknetOS/actions/workflows/Build.yml).

Then execute `HacknetOS.exe` directly, we suggest run the game
on [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US) for a better
experience.

You have to set the size of the console to at lease 220 x 50 characters to execute the game correctly. If your screen is
too small to display full of the game, consider reducing the font size or DPI scaling settings.

Currently, some part of the game supports Chinese only, the i18n is on the way, stay tuned!

### Enable BGM Feature

> This step is optional, the game can work properly without BGM feature.
1. Purchase and download [Hacknet OST](https://store.steampowered.com/app/408710/Hacknet_Official_Soundtrack/)
2. Run `generate_bgm.ps1` using PowerShell to generate bgm directory automatically.
3. Restart the game if started, now bgm should function properly.

Even if you have push rights on the repository, you should create a personal fork and create feature branches there when
you need them. This keeps the main repository clean, and your personal workflow cruft out of sight.
